Work in progress, [Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) blazing fast [clean room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) implementation of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Server.

# Features
- [X] Native perfomance (Rust Programming Language).
- [X] Better memory management.
- [ ] You can have multiple nodes sharing the same world.
- [ ] All vanilla server features.
- [ ] Server side add-ons API (Send custom textures and models from server to client)
- [x] More soonâ„¢ We have some crazy ideas... ;)

# Multi-node world sharing
Each server will load necessary chunks, but not the entire world. Every user and chunk on the network is assigned a timestamp â€“ the date and time when it was created. When a [network split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit) occurs, two users with on each side are free to use the same chunk or nick, but when the two sides are joined, only one can survive. Although this prevents desynchronization, it can lead to loss of changes, so it is more advisable to have stable nodes. Using graph theory, would be something like this:
